# Summary
The map represent the urban area of Bogota D.C Colombia.
It maps the number of homicides in a especifc area of the city, in a given day and hour.
The data consist of the number of homicides during 2010 to 2015 in Bogota D.C.

# Design

I wanted to have a visualization showing the map of Bogota D.C color by the number of homicides,
in a given day and in a given hour. I wanted the viewer to know the regions and the hours were
most of the homicides in the dataset occur.

When I first did it, it wasn't very clear what the visualization was about, so I added some text
with a brief explanation of the dataset. The problem was that with the single coloplett map,
I couldn't show a clear finding of the data to the viewer. I tried to make an animation,
showing the days and hours when the city had more homicides, however the animation wasn't that
good to remind the viewer which places and hours had more homicides in the sample.

Finally I did an animation showing how homicides were distributed across the day of the
week and the hour. I also added a bar graph showing were and when most of the homicides occur in
the sample. 

# Feedback

Carlos Gonzalez:

What do you notice in the visualization?
It seems that most of homicides occurs late at night and in early morning.
What questions do you have about the data?

What relationships do you notice?
The day of the week and hour have a relationship with the number of homicides. Most of the
districst turn red when the night starts in Thursday Friday and Saturday. 
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
The main takeaway was to see the districts and the number of homicides together.

I had hard time telling what was it about... what does those numbers mean 0-4, 4-8 ???

it needs a title and some description 
Play button should be in a different place than the week days

Thanks for sharing your visualization. I love the Oscar Wilde quote! This is a cool visualization tackling a very compelling subject. I had no idea the murder rate in Bogota was so high and there does seem to be some variation based on region and the day of the week. I do have some suggestions to consider:

    This visualization is currently more exploratory than explanatory. Consider the following to enhance the explanatory nature:
        Adjust the initial view to illustrate the key finding or findings in the data. The current initial view is that all regions are de-selected.
        Add a narrative giving context for the data and findings

    The buttons are currently difficult to select, because they are very close together. Consider spacing them out a bit more.

    Make the existence and purpose of the play button clear to the reader. It might be a good idea to start the visualization by playing the animation.

    It's not clear to me how the menu with the homicide range buttons is intended to work. Please make sure its purpose is clear.

I hope this is helpful and I'm looking forward to the next iteration of this viz!
